Sure! Let's merge the two code snippets into a single cohesive program and then analyze the **code execution flow** step by step.

### Merged Code:

```java
class MyClass {
    // Static block, executed when the class is loaded
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block: Class is loaded");
    }

    // Instance initializer block
    {
        System.out.println("Instance initializer block: Object is being created");
    }

    // Constructor
    public MyClass() {
        System.out.println("Constructor: Object is fully created");
    }

    // Static method
    public static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Static method: Executed without an object");
    }

    // Instance method
    public void instanceMethod() {
        System.out.println("Instance method: Executed by an object");
    }

    // Method demonstrating flow of control
    public void controlFlowExample(int x) {
        if (x > 0) {
            System.out.println("Control flow: x is positive");
        } else if (x < 0) {
            System.out.println("Control flow: x is negative");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Control flow: x is zero");
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            System.out.println("Loop: i = " + i);
        }
    }
}

public class Test002066_ExecutionSequenceFlow {

    // Static block
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block 1");
    }

    static int staticVar = initializeStaticVar();

    static {
        System.out.println("Static block 2");
    }

    static int initializeStaticVar() {
        System.out.println("Static variable initialized");
        return 42;
    }

    // Instance block
    {
        System.out.println("Instance block executed");
    }

    int instanceVar = initializeInstanceVar();

    int initializeInstanceVar() {
        System.out.println("Instance variable initialized");
        return 100;
    }

    // Constructor
    public Test002066_ExecutionSequenceFlow() {
        System.out.println("Constructor executed");
    }

    // Main method (Entry point)
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Call static method from MyClass (this will load the class)
        System.out.println("Main method executed");
        MyClass.staticMethod();  // Static method call

        // Step 2: Create object of MyClass (Instance initializer + Constructor)
        MyClass myClassObj = new MyClass();

        // Step 3: Call instance method from MyClass
        myClassObj.instanceMethod();

        // Step 4: Control flow demonstration
        myClassObj.controlFlowExample(1);
        myClassObj.controlFlowExample(0);
        myClassObj.controlFlowExample(-1);

        // Step 5: Create object of Test002066_ExecutionSequenceFlow
        Test002066_ExecutionSequenceFlow obj = new Test002066_ExecutionSequenceFlow();  // Object creation
        obj.myMethod();  // Method call
    }

    // Method
    public void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Method executed");
    }
}
```

### **Execution Flow Analysis**:

#### **1. Class Loading (Static Blocks and Static Variables)**:

When the program starts, the `main` method is called in `Test002066_ExecutionSequenceFlow`, which first loads the class into memory. Before any methods or constructors are executed, the **static blocks** and **static variables** are initialized. This is done once per class, not per instance.

- `MyClass` is loaded when the `staticMethod()` is called in the main method.
- `Test002066_ExecutionSequenceFlow` is loaded when the `main` method is invoked.

### Detailed Execution Steps:

1. **Class Loading of `Test002066_ExecutionSequenceFlow`**:
   - The class `Test002066_ExecutionSequenceFlow` is loaded.
   - The **static blocks** and **static variables** are executed in the order they are defined:
   
   ```
   Static block 1
   Static variable initialized
   Static block 2
   ```

2. **Main Method Execution**:
   - The `main` method is invoked.
   - The output:
   ```
   Main method executed
   ```

3. **Class Loading and Static Method Call (`MyClass`)**:
   - The `MyClass` class is loaded when `MyClass.staticMethod()` is called.
   - The **static block** of `MyClass` is executed:
   
   ```
   Static block: Class is loaded
   Static method: Executed without an object
   ```

4. **Object Creation (`MyClass`)**:
   - An instance of `MyClass` is created, which triggers the **instance initializer block** followed by the **constructor**.
   - The output:
   ```
   Instance initializer block: Object is being created
   Constructor: Object is fully created
   ```

5. **Instance Method Call (`MyClass`)**:
   - The `instanceMethod()` is called using the `MyClass` instance.
   - The output:
   ```
   Instance method: Executed by an object
   ```

6. **Control Flow Demonstration (`MyClass`)**:
   - The method `controlFlowExample()` is called three times with different values (`1`, `0`, `-1`).
   - The output for `controlFlowExample(1)` (x is positive):
     ```
     Control flow: x is positive
     Loop: i = 1
     Loop: i = 2
     Loop: i = 3
     ```
   - The output for `controlFlowExample(0)` (x is zero):
     ```
     Control flow: x is zero
     Loop: i = 1
     Loop: i = 2
     Loop: i = 3
     ```
   - The output for `controlFlowExample(-1)` (x is negative):
     ```
     Control flow: x is negative
     Loop: i = 1
     Loop: i = 2
     Loop: i = 3
     ```

7. **Object Creation (`Test002066_ExecutionSequenceFlow`)**:
   - The instance of `Test002066_ExecutionSequenceFlow` is created, which triggers the **instance initializer block** and then the **constructor**.
   - The output:
   ```
   Instance block executed
   Instance variable initialized
   Constructor executed
   ```

8. **Method Call (`Test002066_ExecutionSequenceFlow`)**:
   - The `myMethod()` is called using the created instance.
   - The output:
   ```
   Method executed
   ```

### **Full Output**:

```plaintext
Static block 1
Static variable initialized
Static block 2
Main method executed
Static block: Class is loaded
Static method: Executed without an object
Instance initializer block: Object is being created
Constructor: Object is fully created
Instance method: Executed by an object
Control flow: x is positive
Loop: i = 1
Loop: i = 2
Loop: i = 3
Control flow: x is zero
Loop: i = 1
Loop: i = 2
Loop: i = 3
Control flow: x is negative
Loop: i = 1
Loop: i = 2
Loop: i = 3
Instance block executed
Instance variable initialized
Constructor executed
Method executed
```

### **Conclusion and Key Takeaways**:

1. **Static Blocks and Variables**:
   - Static blocks and static variables are executed **once** when the class is first loaded.
   - They are executed in the order they are defined.

2. **Main Method**:
   - The `main` method is the entry point of the program. Its execution starts after the static initialization is complete.

3. **Class Loading and Object Creation**:
   - When a class is referenced, it is loaded into memory (static blocks are executed).
   - During object creation, instance initializer blocks are executed **before the constructor**.

4. **Method Calls**:
   - Static methods can be called without creating an instance of the class.
   - Instance methods are called on objects and follow object creation.

This code demonstrates the **initialization sequence** in Java, showcasing how static and instance blocks, constructors, and methods are executed during a programâ€™s runtime.

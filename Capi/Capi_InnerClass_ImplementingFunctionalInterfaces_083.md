Sure! Let's explore the two approaches you mentioned for handling multiple interfaces with anonymous inner classes: **using lambda expressions** for functional interfaces and **using composition** by creating separate anonymous inner classes for each interface.

### 1. **Using Lambda Expressions (for Functional Interfaces)**

A **lambda expression** can only be used with **functional interfaces**. A **functional interface** is an interface that contains exactly **one abstract method**. Examples include `Runnable`, `Callable`, `Comparator`, or custom functional interfaces annotated with `@FunctionalInterface`.

In Java, instead of creating anonymous inner classes, you can use lambda expressions to represent the behavior of functional interfaces concisely. However, since a lambda expression only works with a single functional interface, you can still implement multiple interfaces by defining separate lambda expressions for each interface.

#### Example of Using Lambda Expressions:
Let’s say you have two functional interfaces:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Interface1 {
    void method1();
}

@FunctionalInterface
interface Interface2 {
    void method2();
}
```

Here’s how you can implement both using lambda expressions:

```java
Interface1 obj1 = () -> System.out.println("Lambda for Interface1");
Interface2 obj2 = () -> System.out.println("Lambda for Interface2");

obj1.method1();  // Output: Lambda for Interface1
obj2.method2();  // Output: Lambda for Interface2
```

You are essentially implementing both interfaces with separate lambda expressions. The key here is that you can only use lambdas for functional interfaces.

If one of your interfaces isn't a functional interface, or you need to implement more than one method from different interfaces, lambda expressions won’t be enough, and you will have to use a different strategy, like composition.

### 2. **Using Composition (Separate Anonymous Inner Classes for Each Interface)**

Since an **anonymous inner class** can only implement one interface at a time, but you may need to implement multiple interfaces, you can use **composition** by creating separate anonymous inner classes for each interface and combining them.

#### Example of Composition:
Let's say you have two interfaces:

```java
interface Interface1 {
    void method1();
}

interface Interface2 {
    void method2();
}
```

Now, let’s implement both interfaces using separate anonymous inner classes and compose them:

```java
Interface1 obj1 = new Interface1() {
    @Override
    public void method1() {
        System.out.println("Anonymous class implementing Interface1");
    }
};

Interface2 obj2 = new Interface2() {
    @Override
    public void method2() {
        System.out.println("Anonymous class implementing Interface2");
    }
};

// You can call the methods from each separate instance
obj1.method1();  // Output: Anonymous class implementing Interface1
obj2.method2();  // Output: Anonymous class implementing Interface2
```

#### Composition Strategy: Combining Objects
If you need both interfaces' behavior within the same object or method, you can **combine** these separate objects into a container class or a method.

Example of combining both behaviors in a container class:

```java
class Combined {
    Interface1 obj1 = new Interface1() {
        @Override
        public void method1() {
            System.out.println("Anonymous class implementing Interface1");
        }
    };

    Interface2 obj2 = new Interface2() {
        @Override
        public void method2() {
            System.out.println("Anonymous class implementing Interface2");
        }
    };

    void doBoth() {
        obj1.method1();
        obj2.method2();
    }
}

// Usage
Combined combined = new Combined();
combined.doBoth();
// Output:
// Anonymous class implementing Interface1
// Anonymous class implementing Interface2
```

In this example, we combined both anonymous inner classes into a `Combined` class, which contains objects for both interfaces. You can then call methods from both interfaces within a single method like `doBoth()`.

### Key Points:
- **Lambda Expressions**: Can be used if you are dealing with **functional interfaces**. Since each functional interface has only one method, you can create separate lambda expressions for each interface.
- **Composition**: You can create multiple anonymous inner classes, each implementing a different interface, and then **compose** them either in a container class or method that coordinates their functionality.

Both approaches provide a solution for working with multiple interfaces while adhering to the limitation of an anonymous inner class implementing only one interface at a time.

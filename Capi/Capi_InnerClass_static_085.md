The key difference between these two snippets lies in whether class `B` is a **static nested class** or a **non-static inner class**, which affects how `B` is instantiated and its relationship to the outer class `A`.

### **Snippet 1: Static Nested Class `B`**

```java
class A {       
    static class B {   // B is a static nested class
        // Code for B
    }
}
```

#### Key Points:
- **Class `A`**: This is a regular (non-static) top-level class.
- **Class `B`**: `B` is a **static nested class**. Static nested classes do not require an instance of the outer class (`A`) to be instantiated. They behave more like top-level classes and are independent of an instance of `A`.

#### Instantiating Class `B`:
Since `B` is static, you can instantiate it without creating an instance of `A`. The correct syntax is:

```java
A.B obj = new A.B();  // Valid, no instance of A needed
```

- The instantiation does not depend on an existing instance of `A`.

### **Snippet 2: Non-static Inner Class `B`**

```java
class A {       
    class B {   // B is a non-static inner class
        // Code for B
    }
}
```

#### Key Points:
- **Class `A`**: A regular (non-static) top-level class.
- **Class `B`**: `B` is a **non-static inner class** of `A`. This means that each instance of `B` is tied to an instance of `A`, and an instance of `A` is required to create an instance of `B`.

#### Instantiating Class `B`:
Because `B` is a non-static inner class, you must first create an instance of `A` before you can instantiate `B`. The syntax for instantiating `B` is:

```java
A outer = new A();      // Create an instance of A
A.B obj = outer.new B();  // Create an instance of B using the instance of A
```

- Here, `outer` is the instance of class `A`, and you need it to create an instance of the inner class `B`.

---

### **Differences in Instantiating `B`:**

1. **In Snippet 1 (Static Nested Class `B`)**:
   - **No instance of `A`** is required to create an instance of `B`.
   - You can directly instantiate `B` using `new A.B()`.
   
   ```java
   A.B obj = new A.B();  // Valid and straightforward
   ```

2. **In Snippet 2 (Non-static Inner Class `B`)**:
   - An **instance of `A` is required** to create an instance of `B`.
   - You must first create an instance of `A` and then use it to instantiate `B`.

   ```java
   A outer = new A();         // Create an instance of A
   A.B obj = outer.new B();   // Use the instance of A to create B
   ```

---

### **Summary of the Differences:**
- **Snippet 1 (Static Nested Class)**:
   - `B` is a static nested class.
   - You can instantiate `B` without an instance of `A` using `new A.B()`.
   - Example:
     ```java
     A.B obj = new A.B();
     ```

- **Snippet 2 (Non-static Inner Class)**:
   - `B` is a non-static inner class.
   - You must first create an instance of `A` to instantiate `B`.
   - Example:
     ```java
     A outer = new A();      // Create an instance of A
     A.B obj = outer.new B();  // Create an instance of B using the instance of A
     ```

In summary, the key difference is that a **static nested class** can be instantiated without an instance of the outer class, while a **non-static inner class** requires an instance of the outer class for instantiation.

# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The difference in instantiation comes from the fact that `class B` is a **static nested class**, which behaves differently from non-static inner classes.

Let’s break down the reasoning for each case:

### **1. `B obj1 = new B();`**

This works because `B` is a **static** nested class. A static nested class can be instantiated without the need for an instance of the outer class (`Test002086`). In this case, the `static` keyword means that `B` exists independently of any instance of the outer class, so you can instantiate `B` directly like this.

### **3. `B obj3 = new Test002086().new B();`**

This does **not work** because you're trying to instantiate `B` as if it were a **non-static** inner class. If `B` were non-static, it would require an instance of the outer class `Test002086` to be created, but since `B` is **static**, this is unnecessary and incorrect.

- A **non-static** inner class (without the `static` keyword) would need an instance of the outer class to access it, like this:

    ```java
    OuterClass outer = new OuterClass();
    OuterClass.InnerClass inner = outer.new InnerClass();
    ```

    However, since `B` is **static**, no outer class instance is needed, and the syntax in line 3 is invalid. A **static nested class** doesn't maintain a reference to an instance of the enclosing class.

### **4. `Test002086.B obj4 = new Test002086().new B();`**

This also **does not work** for the same reason. Even though you're explicitly referencing the outer class (`Test002086`), the `new Test002086().new B()` syntax is used for **non-static** inner classes, which require an instance of the outer class. But because `B` is a **static nested class**, you don't need an instance of the outer class (`Test002086`) to create an instance of `B`.

### **Why 1 Works and 3, 4 Do Not:**

- In **case 1**, you're directly instantiating `B` as a **static** class, which is allowed because it is independent of any instance of `Test002086`.

- In **cases 3 and 4**, you're trying to instantiate `B` as if it were a **non-static inner class**, which would require an instance of the outer class (`Test002086`). Since `B` is static, it does not require such an instance, making the syntax you're using in these cases invalid.

### General Rule:

- **Static Nested Class:**  
  A static nested class behaves like a top-level class that is *nested inside another class*. It does **not require** an instance of the enclosing class to be instantiated.  
  - **Correct syntax:** `OuterClass.StaticNestedClass nested = new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();`
  
- **Non-Static Inner Class:**  
  A non-static inner class requires an instance of the outer class to be instantiated. It implicitly holds a reference to the enclosing instance.  
  - **Correct syntax:** `OuterClass.InnerClass inner = outerInstance.new InnerClass();`

Since `B` is a **static nested class**, you should instantiate it directly without creating an instance of `Test002086`.

This code will output:

```
null
```

### Explanation:
1. **The `Person` method is not a constructor**:  
   - The method `public void Person()` looks like a constructor at first glance, but it is **not** a constructor because:
     - A constructor **does not have a return type** (even `void` is not allowed for a constructor).
     - Since `Person()` has a `void` return type, it is treated as a **regular method**, not a constructor.

2. **No explicit constructor**:
   - Since no constructor is defined explicitly in the class, the Java compiler provides a **default constructor**. This default constructor does nothing beyond default initialization of instance variables.

3. **Default initialization**:
   - The instance variable `name` is of type `String`, which is initialized to `null` by default when the object is created.

4. **Output**:
   - When the `main` method creates a new `Person` object with `Person obj = new Person();`, the default constructor is invoked.
   - The `name` field is not explicitly assigned a value, so it remains `null`.
   - `System.out.println(obj.name);` prints `null`.

### Correcting the Code:
If you want the `Person` constructor to initialize the `name` field, remove the `void` return type from the `Person` method:

```java
public class Person {
    public String name;

    // Proper constructor
    public Person() {
        name = "James";
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person obj = new Person();
        System.out.println(obj.name); // Outputs: James
    }
}
```
